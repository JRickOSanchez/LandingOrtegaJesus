                <p>In my free time I usually watch different entertainment media, but one of the ones I usually consume
                    the most is anime, I usually watch anime and read manga (Japanese comics) every time I can or when
                    one comes out that interests me. My favorite anime are Mob Psycho 100, Death Note, Evangelion and
                    Bocchi The Rock. And my favorite manga are Tokyo Ghoul, Soul Eater and One Piece.</p>

                <p>Whenever I can I like to test and investigate things related to technology, either software or
                    hardware, I like to assemble computers and see the new things that are coming to market regarding
                    hardware and whenever I see something new that looks very striking or novel I always have the desire
                    to try it to see how it is or rather experience the experience.</p>

                <h2>My favorite movies</h2>
                <h5>Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy</h5>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="img/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Mis peilculas favoritas">
                <p>Spider-Man directed by Sam Raimi and starring Tobey Maguire are one of my favorite movie sagas,
                    because besides being Spider-Man my favorite super hero, they are movies that marked my childhood.
                    Besides, in spite of telling you the trajectory that our character takes in the movies, it always
                    ends up giving us multiple meaningful messages, such as: take responsibility for your actions, deal
                    with loss, it is always good to be willing to ask for help, etc.</p>
                <h5>Joker</h5>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="img/joker-joaquin-phoenix.jpg" alt="Mis peilculas favoritas">
                <p>Joker is a movie that I like a lot, because it is a movie based on the super hero comics, very
                    different from how we had raised for years and other productions of the same, giving a darker and
                    "realistic" perspective on how a person can reach the breaking point or even to the same madness.
                    This film is a social criticism of how the same people within a society can be the triggers or the
                    cause of someone despite wanting to take the right path or the right decisions pushes them and
                    decides them directly to want to take dark actions giving birth to people like the protagonist of
                    this film.</p>
                <h5>Spider-Man in to the spider-verse</h5>
                <img class="img-fluid"
                    src="img/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-2-secuela-amy-pascal-novedades-cover.jpg"
                    alt="Mis peilculas favoritas">
                <p>Spider-Man in to the spider-verse is one of my favorite animated movies, because it tells the origin
                    of a version of spider-man not as well known as Miles Morales at that time. Besides the animation
                    style that was revolutionary and very much in the style of the comics, it gives us some messages
                    that are very important in its great story, it makes it clear that we can all be a spider-man in the
                    metaphorical sense, since we all have problems and responsibilities with which we have to deal, and
                    the answer to that is "no matter how many times I fall, I will always get up and keep fighting" and
                    also "you never know when you'll be ready, life is a leap of faith and you always have to trust in
                    yourself and your abilities".</p>

                <h2 class="mt-5">My favorite series</h2>
                <h5>Invincible</h5>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="img/invincible.jpg" alt="Mis series favoritas">
                <p>Invincible, based on the comics of the same name is an animated series aimed at an adult audience.
                    Invincible could easily have been little more than a parody of other superheroes, in many of those
                    who appear in the series could not be more evident which is the original model, also including gore
                    in the series. For me, it is one of the best superhero series of recent years is that it also still
                    has a lot of story to tell in future seasons.</p>
                <h5>Malcolm in the middle</h5>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="img/malcolm.jpg" alt="Mis series favoritas">
                <p>Malcolm in the middle is a comedy series where it tells the story of a dysfunctional family like
                    Malcolm's, this series has several comic hisotrias and even messages that help the characters grow.
                    I really like this series mainly because of the comedy and the situations the characters get into.
